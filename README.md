### Description

This repository hosts the files and scripts used for generative dialogue modeling experiments described in the paper:

Multiresolution Recurrent Neural Networks: An Application to Dialogue Response Generation. Iulian Vlad Serban, Tim Klinger, Gerald Tesauro, Kartik Talamadupula, Bowen Zhou, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. 2016. http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00776.

The repository includes scripts to recreate and modify the noun and activity-entity representations, and to evaluate dialogue response generation on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus.

See README files inside each directory for further information.

The pre-processed Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, noun representations, activity-entity representations and model responses are available at: http://www.iulianserban.com/Files/UbuntuDialogueCorpus.zip.

The original Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus as released by Lowe et al. (2015) can be found here: http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/datasets/ubuntu-corpus-1.0/
