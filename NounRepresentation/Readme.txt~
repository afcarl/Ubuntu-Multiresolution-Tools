### Description

This directory contains the files for regenerating the noun representations for the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus described by Serban et al. (2016).

The noun representations can be created by running:

    python generate_nouns.py <dialogue_corpus> <tmp_a> <tmp_b> <coarse_representations>

<dialogue_corpus> is a file of consisting of dialogues (one dialogue per line), where turns are separated by the token "__eot__" and utterances are separated by the token "__eou__".
<tmp_a> and <tmp_b> are temporary intermediate files that the script needs to store. These can safely be deleted afterwards.
<coarse_representations> is the output file containing of the coarse noun representations.



### Files:

    commands_all: Contains set of all general linux commands
    commands_conflicts: Contains set of general linux commands which have
                        names conflicting with common use verbs.
    generate_nouns.py: Script which generates noun abstractions from dialogues.
    generate_POSTags.sh: Helper script used to call the POS tagger.
