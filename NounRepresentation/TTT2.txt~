anyone knows why my stock oneiric exports env var ' **unknown** I mean what is that used for ? I know of $USER but not $USERNAME . My precise install doesn't export USERNAME __eou__ __eot__ looks like it used to be exported by lightdm , but the line had the comment " // **unknown** : Is this required ?" so I guess it isn't surprising it is gone __eou__ __eot__ thanks ! How the heck did you figure that out ? __eou__ __eot__ https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/864109/comments/3 __eou__ __eot__
i set up my hd such that i have to type a passphrase to access it at boot . how can i remove that passwrd , and just boot up normal . i did this at install , it works fine , just tired of having reboots where i need to be at terminal to type passwd in . help ? __eou__ __eot__ backup your data , and re-install without encryption " might " be the easiest method __eou__ __eot__
im trying to use ubuntu on my macbook pro retina __eou__ i read in the forums that ubuntu has a apple version now ? __eou__ __eot__ not that ive ever heard of .. normal ubutnu should work on an intel based mac . there is the PPC version also . __eou__ you want total control ? or what are you wanting exactly ? __eou__ __eot__
no suggestions ? __eou__ links ? __eou__ how can i remove luks passphrase at boot . i dont want to use feature anymore ... __eou__ __eot__ you may need to create a new volume __eou__ __eot__ that leads me to the next question lol ... i dont know how to create new volumes exactly in cmdline , usually i use a gui . im just trying to access this server via usb loaded with next os im going to load , the luks pw is stopping me __eou__ __eot__ for something like that I would likely use something like a live gparted disk to avoid the conflict of editing from the disk __eou__ __eot__
